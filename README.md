# Old Garry's Mod Addons

Back in 2016-2017, I got deep into the Garry's Mod addon development scene since I wanted to learn how to program, and also get some extra money. I created a couple of game community servers, as well as several commercial addons sold in ScriptFodder, currently known as Garry's Mod Store.

I stopped giving support to these addons when I started my senior year, so I decided to upload them publicly in case someone wants to try them out for free, or use some of the code for reference. Keep in mind, I was 16 when I developed most of this, so don't be surprised if you find some horrifying code.
