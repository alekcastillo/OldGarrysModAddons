Thanks for buying my script, if you enjoy it, please remember to post a review of it!
That helps me alot!
Also, remember that if you bought this script on the first week of its release, you can get another script for free!
Just post a 5 stars review of this, and pm me with the script you want. You can choose 1 of my 2 other scripts, 
GTA V Wanted System, or Advanced Bailing System. Thanks!

-- Installation --
Just drag and drop the 'cartoonhud' folder to your addons folder in your game server.

-- Configuration --
To change your script config, edit the cartoonhud_config.lua file in the cartoonhud/lua/ folder!
To change the hud's theme, use the cartoonhud_theme_config.lua located in the same folder.
I recommend using notepad++ or sublime text for this.

-- Support --

Adding me for support will get you instantly blocked!
